# Welcome

!!! note ""
    **AppVerify Code API** will officially be renamed to <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/HiTECH-Corporation/The-Project-Docs@latest/assets/AuthKit-API/authkit-logo.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> in the upcoming v2. We'll update the changelog soon!

Welcome to **AppVerify Code API**. You can find documentation on how to use the API, instructions on creating a simple project with **AppVerify Code API**, and more.

Before reading this document, make sure you have an **AVC Authkey** (or `authkey`) to use with the **AppVerify Code API**. If you do not have an **AVC Authkey**, you can use **AVC Manager** to create a new **AVC AuthKey**.

!!! warning ""
    **AppVerify Code** is still under development, so the **AVC Authkey** generation feature will be temporarily disabled until **AppVerify Code API** and **AVC Manager** systems are fully completed.

!!! note ""
    New to **AppVerify Code API** or looking to explore its capabilities for your application? You can use the test AVC Authkey provided below:
